                    This is a floated div on the left side.

                <div class="right bg-red padded">
                    This is a floated div on the right side. <br/> Notice how floated divs don't automatically fill any space-<br/> they scale to their contents, in this case text.
                </div>
                <div class="bg-yellow padded textcenter">
                    <span>Floats can be used to align elements to the left side (which is a default) or the right side of their parent container.
                        However, they are mostly useful for making text flow around things- like an inset photograph in an article. Don't base your layout on floats!
                        They are really unwieldy compared to more modern stuff like flex-box.

        <section class="center-column bg-olive padded row rel clearfix">
            This is a relatively-positioned area which hosts two absolutely-positioned elements. Notice how they can float over the text and don't seem to have the same rules.
            <div id="first-bubble" class="bg-yellow padded">This is an absolutely-positioned div.</div>
            <div id="second-bubble" class="gfruit_sunset padded">Here's another.</div>
