                In my opinion, when we talk about God
                making man in His own image and likeness,
                we should understand that the likeness 
                has to do with His essence, and this is creation.
                From this comes the possibility
                Of evaluating a work and what it represents.
                In short, the meaning of art
                is the search for God in man.

                We are crucified on one plane,
                while the world is many-dimensional.
                We are aware of that
                and are tormented by our inability
                to know the truth.
                But there is no need to know it!
                We need love.
                And to believe.

                The first half of the film
                will probably be set in Bagno Vignoni.
                But not the real place - in an invented one.
                Where there is only the pool,
                and everything is dilapidated,
                more intimate, more provincial.
                From the very beginning, everything
                will take place near the pool by the hotel.
                Therefore I shall have to recreate
                the atmosphere of the place in detail

                Last night I dreamt that I had died.
                But I could see, or rather feel,
                what was going on around me.
                I could feel that Lara was beside me,
                and one of my friends.
                I felt I had no strength or will,
                I was only capable of witnessing
                my own death, my own corpse.

                The image is not a certain meaning,
                expressed by the director,
                but the entire world,
                reflected as in a drop of water.

                I had a strange dream last night:
                I was looking up at the sky,
                and it was very, very light, and soft;
                and high, high above it seemed to be slowly boiling,
                like light that had materialized,
                like the fibres of a sunlit fabric,
                like silken, living stitches
                in a piece of Japanese embroidery.

        <div class="grid-child page">

                And those tiny fibres, light-bearing, living threads,
                seemed to be moving and floating
                and becoming like birds, hovering, so high up,
                that they could never be reached.

                I dreamt of the quiet monastery cloister
                with its enormous ancient oak tree.
                Suddenly I become aware of a flame rising up
                at a point among the roots.

                How does a project mature?
                It is obviously a most mysterious,
                imperceptible process.
                It carries on independently of ourselves,
                in the subconscious,
                crystallizing on the walls of the soul.

                It is the form of the soul
                that makes it unique,
                indeed only the soul decides,
                the hidden 'gestation period' of that image
                which cannot be perceived
                by the conscious gaze.

                For many millenia,
                man has been striving after happiness;
                but he is not happy. Why not?
                Because he cannot achieve it,
                because he does not know the way -
                both these reasons.

                Above all, however,
                because in our earthly lives
                there must not be ultimate happiness,
                but only the aspiration towards it,

                in the struggling between good and evil,
                that the spirit is forged.
