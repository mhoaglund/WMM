            <h1>General Layout</h1>
            <p>CSS is your toolbox for creating structure within your webpage, beyond what HTML alone is capable of.
                CSS is also the source of the webpage's aesthetic- design of the layout, colors, typefaces, and so forth.
            </p>
            <div>
                <div class="left bg-olive padded">
                    This is a floated div on the left side.
                </div>
                <div class="right bg-red padded">
                    This is a floated div on the right side. <br/> Notice how floated divs don't automatically fill any space-<br/> they scale to their contents, in this case text.
                </div>
                <div class="bg-yellow padded textcenter">
                    <span>Floats can be used to align elements to the left side (which is a default) or the right side of their parent container.</span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="center-column bg-olive padded row rel clearfix">
            This is a relatively-positioned area which hosts two absolutely-positioned element. Notice how they can float over the text and don't seem to have the same rules.
            <div id="first-bubble" class="bg-yellow padded">This is an absolutely-positioned div.</div>
            <div id="second-bubble" class="gfruit_sunset padded">Here's another.</div>
